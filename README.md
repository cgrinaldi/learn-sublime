# Goto Anything in Sublime Text 3

_Goto Anything_ is a very powerful way to navigate your file system without having to use the mouse, which can greatly enhance the speed with which you navigate a project.

This lesson will help you practice _Goto Anything_. The commands covered in this branch are:

* Goto Anything: `Command + P`
* Toggle Sidebar: `Command + K, Command + B`
* Close a Tab: `Command + W`
* Tab Cycling: `Shift + Command + [ (or ])`

There are a number of files in this repo, but start at lesson.md for instructions on how to proceed through the lesson.

To begin, make sure to do the following:

File > Open... > learn-sublime (folder)

This will open up the entire project and give you quick access to all of the files in this directory.

Good luck!
